# odin-etch

This is a project that is part of the Odin Project Fundamentals curriculum.

The goal of this assignment is to help me put into practice what I've learned so far during the course.
That includes all of the previous knowledge about HTML, CSS, Flexbox, and basic Javascript, as well as my newly-acquired DOM Manipulation abilities. 

This small project is a browser version of an Etch-a-Sketch device and should give me an idea of how all my skills gel together and contribute to the final result.
